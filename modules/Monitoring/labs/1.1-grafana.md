# Lab: Introduction to Grafana

## Overview
In this lab, you'll get your first hands-on experience with Grafana, a powerful open-source platform for monitoring and observability. You'll learn how to run Grafana using Docker, explore the UI, create dashboards, and connect to data sources. While Grafana can connect to almost any data source, it's most commonly used for application observability—helping teams improve reliability and handle incident response proactively.

---

## Part 1: What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source analytics and visualization platform. It allows you to:

- **Visualize data** from many different sources (databases, APIs, CSV files, etc.)
- **Create dashboards** with charts, graphs, and alerts
- **Monitor applications and infrastructure** in real-time
- **Collaborate** with teams on shared dashboards

### Why Grafana for Observability?

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Application Monitoring | Track response times, error rates, throughput |
| Infrastructure Monitoring | CPU, memory, disk, network metrics |
| Incident Response | Quickly identify and troubleshoot issues |
| Alerting | Get notified when metrics exceed thresholds |

Grafana supports many data sources including Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and even simple CSV files!

## Part 2: Running Grafana with Docker

Grafana is an application that runs as a web server. We'll run it using Docker so you can see it in action quickly.

### Step 1: Start Grafana Container

Run the following command to start Grafana:

```bash
docker run -d --name grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

**What this command does:**
| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-d` | Run container in detached (background) mode |
| `--name grafana` | Give the container a friendly name |
| `-p 3000:3000` | Map port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container |
| `grafana/grafana` | The official Grafana Docker image |

### Step 2: Verify the Container is Running

Check that Grafana is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see output similar to:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND     STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
abc123def456   grafana/grafana   "/run.sh"   Up 10 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   grafana
```

### Step 3: View Application Logs

Grafana is a real application—it writes logs just like any other service. View them with:

```bash
docker logs grafana
```

You'll see startup messages like:

```
logger=settings t=2026-01-17T12:00:00Z level=info msg="Starting Grafana" version=10.x.x
logger=http.server t=2026-01-17T12:00:01Z level=info msg="HTTP Server Listen" address=0.0.0.0:3000
```

**Pro tip:** To follow logs in real-time (like `tail -f`):

```bash
docker logs -f grafana
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following.

## Part 3: Exploring the Grafana UI

### Step 1: Access Grafana

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

If running on a remote server, replace `localhost` with your server's IP address.

### Step 2: Login

Default credentials:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

You'll be prompted to change the password on first login. You can skip this for a lab environment.

### Step 3: Explore the Interface

Take a few minutes to explore:

| Area | What You'll Find |
|------|------------------|
| **Home** | Welcome dashboard, recent items |
| **Dashboards** | Create and manage dashboards |
| **Connections** | Add and configure data sources |
| **Alerting** | Set up alert rules and notifications |
| **Administration** | Users, teams, settings |

Click around! Grafana is designed to be intuitive.

## Part 4: Adding a CSV Data Source

Grafana can visualize data from almost anywhere. Let's start with something simple—a CSV file uploaded directly to Grafana.

### Step 1: Install the CSV Plugin

By default, Grafana supports many data sources. For CSV files, we can use the built-in "TestData" source or upload data directly when creating panels.

### Step 2: Create Sample Data

Create a file called `metrics.csv` on your local machine with the following content:

```csv
timestamp,cpu_usage,memory_usage,response_time_ms
2026-01-17 08:00:00,45,62,120
2026-01-17 09:00:00,52,65,135
2026-01-17 10:00:00,78,71,180
2026-01-17 11:00:00,65,68,150
2026-01-17 12:00:00,55,64,140
2026-01-17 13:00:00,48,61,125
2026-01-17 14:00:00,92,85,350
2026-01-17 15:00:00,88,82,320
2026-01-17 16:00:00,62,70,160
2026-01-17 17:00:00,45,58,110
```

### Step 3: Create a Dashboard with CSV Data

1. Click **Dashboards** in the left menu
2. Click **New** → **New Dashboard**
3. Click **Add visualization**
4. For data source, select **-- Grafana --** (built-in)
5. In the query section, select **Random Walk** to start with sample data

**Note:** For production use, you would typically connect Grafana to a time-series database like Prometheus or InfluxDB. For learning, the built-in data sources work great!

---

## Part 5: Creating Your First Dashboard

### Step 1: Create a New Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** → **New** → **New Dashboard**
2. Click **Add visualization**

### Step 2: Configure a Panel

1. Select **-- Grafana --** as the data source
2. Choose **Random Walk** as the scenario
3. The preview will show a line graph with random data
4. Give your panel a title: "Sample Metrics"
5. Click **Apply**

### Step 3: Add More Panels

Repeat the process to add different visualizations:

| Panel Type | Good For |
|------------|----------|
| Time series | Metrics over time |
| Gauge | Current values with thresholds |
| Stat | Single important numbers |
| Bar chart | Comparing categories |
| Table | Detailed data view |

### Step 4: Save Your Dashboard

1. Click the **Save** icon (💾) in the top right
2. Give your dashboard a name: "My First Dashboard"
3. Click **Save**

---

## Part 6: Connecting to a Data Source

While we used built-in data for learning, real-world Grafana deployments connect to external data sources.

### Step 1: Navigate to Data Sources

1. Click **Connections** in the left menu
2. Click **Data sources**
3. Click **Add data source**

### Step 2: Explore Available Data Sources

You'll see many options:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Time series | Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite |
| Logging | Loki, Elasticsearch |
| Databases | MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
| Cloud | AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud |
| Other | JSON API, CSV, Google Sheets |

### Step 3: Add a TestData Source (For Practice)

1. Search for **TestData**
2. Click on it
3. Click **Save & test**

This gives you a data source for experimenting without needing external services.

## Part 7: Understanding Grafana for Observability

Grafana shines when used for **application observability**. Here's why teams use it:

### The Three Pillars of Observability

| Pillar | Description | Grafana Support |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Metrics** | Numeric measurements over time | Prometheus, InfluxDB dashboards |
| **Logs** | Text records of events | Loki integration |
| **Traces** | Request flow through services | Tempo, Jaeger integration |

### How Grafana Improves Reliability

1. **Proactive Monitoring** - See problems before users report them
2. **Faster Incident Response** - Dashboards show what's wrong quickly
3. **Historical Analysis** - Understand trends and patterns
4. **Alerting** - Get notified when things go wrong

### Real-World Example

Imagine your web application slows down:

1. **Without Grafana:** Users complain → You scramble to find the issue → Downtime
2. **With Grafana:** Alert fires → Dashboard shows high CPU → You scale resources → Minimal impact

---

## Part 8: Cleanup

When you're done experimenting, clean up:

```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop grafana

# Remove the container
docker rm grafana

# (Optional) Remove the image
docker rmi grafana/grafana
```

To start fresh later:

```bash
docker run -d --name grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

---

## Challenge

Now that you understand the basics, try these challenges:

1. **Create a multi-panel dashboard** with at least 4 different visualization types
2. **Experiment with panel options** - change colors, thresholds, and legends
3. **Set up an alert** - configure an alert rule on one of your panels
4. **Explore the Grafana documentation** at https://grafana.com/docs/
